Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

It is the systematic application of engineering principles and practices to design, develop, test and maintain software systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Agile development - agile methodologies assisted to address the limitations of traditional waterfall models by promoting adaptability. <br/>
Object-Oriented programming - it provides a more modular and reusaable approach thus the softaware systems become more scalable and maintainable. <br/>
The Software Crisis - it led to the emergence of structured programming and software engineering as a formal discipline. <br/>

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning - it is initial phase that involves defining the project scope, odjectives and requirements
Analysis  - the requirements are analyzed in order to understand the system's functionalities and specifications. <br/>
Design - the system's architecture and design are developed based on the requirements analysis<br/>
Development - coding and the implementation of the software takes place <br/>
Testing - the software is tested to identify and fix bugs <br/>
Development - the finished software is deployed into production environment for use by end-users <br/>
Maintenance - the software is monitored, updated and supported after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology follows a linear approach. It entails moving from one phase to another in a waterfall manner while agile methodolgy involves breaking down the project into smaller sprints. <br/>
Waterfall is suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal uncertainity while agile is suitable for projects with evolving requirements.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer - he/she develops software components based on design specifications <br/>
Quality Assurance Engineer - designs and executes test cases to identify bugs in the software <br/>
Project Manager - he/she defines the project scope, goals and timelines 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs are used to edit code, debug, build automation while VCS are used to track changes, foster collaboration and revert changes.  <br/>
Examples of:  IDEs include VS Code and Eclipse. VCEs include Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Evolving requirements - projects often face changing requirements throughout their development cycle <br/>
Team collaboration - ensuring effective communication among team members <br/>
Tight deadlines - Meeting strict deadlines while maintaining quality can become a challenge <br/>

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing - it is done in order to verify the correctness of individual software components <br/>
Integration testing - it verifies the interactions between different software components  <br/>
System testing - it evaluates the entire system against its specified requirements <br/>
Acceptance - it verifies that the software meets the customer's requirements and is ready for deployment <br/>

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the art of crafting effective prompts to guide AI models like large language models towards generating desired and informative responses. <br/>
Well-crafted prompts provide clear instructions, reducing ambiguity and ensuring the AI model understands the desired task.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective. 

An example of a vague prompt: "Tell me about the French Revolution."
The prompt is vague because it lacks specificity and leaves room for interpretation. It doesn't indicate what aspect of the French Revolution one is interested in. <br/>
Improved prompt: "Explain the causes and key figures of the French Revolution."
It clearly states that the one wants information about the causes and key figures, providing a specific direction for the response.
